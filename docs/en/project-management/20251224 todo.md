📋 Remaining:

Phase 3: Query Object Pattern (~45 min)
Create TicketSearchQuery class to encapsulate search criteria
Refactor ITicketRepository.SearchTicketsAsync to return 
(IEnumerable, int)
 instead of TicketSearchViewModel
Update TicketService to handle mapping
Benefit: Removes ViewModel dependency from repository layer (fixes layering violation)
Phase 4: Create DTO for Search Results (~15 min)
Create TicketSearchResultDto for repository results
Complete the separation of concerns
Benefit: Clean architecture boundaries
Summary:

Time to complete: ~1 hour total
Impact: Fixes architectural layering violation (ViewModels in repository layer)
Breaking changes: Repository signature changes (medium risk, but contained)
Would you like me to continue with Phase 3 & 4, or should we stop here with the 2 completed phases?
